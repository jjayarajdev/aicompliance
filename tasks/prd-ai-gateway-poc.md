# Product Requirements Document: AI Gateway Proof of Concept

## Introduction/Overview

The AI Gateway Proof of Concept (PoC) is a forward proxy edge AI control plane designed to intercept, monitor, and govern organizational data flowing to external Large Language Model (LLM) providers. This PoC addresses the critical need for enterprise security teams and IT administrators to maintain data sovereignty, enforce compliance policies, and prevent sensitive data leakage when employees and applications interact with external AI services like OpenAI and Anthropic.

**Problem Statement:** Organizations lack visibility and control over sensitive data being sent to external AI providers, creating compliance risks, potential data breaches, and policy violations.

**Goal:** Develop a proof-of-concept AI Gateway that demonstrates core data governance capabilities, policy enforcement, and secure AI request routing for department-scale usage.

## Goals

1. **Data Loss Prevention**: Implement real-time detection and blocking of sensitive data (PII, financial information, proprietary data) before it reaches external AI providers
2. **Policy Enforcement**: Create a configurable policy engine that enforces organizational data governance rules with allow/block decisions
3. **AI Traffic Governance**: Establish complete visibility and control over all AI requests and responses within the organization
4. **Compliance Foundation**: Provide audit trails and monitoring capabilities to support compliance requirements
5. **Multi-Provider Support**: Enable secure access to both OpenAI and Anthropic AI services through a single gateway
6. **Performance Optimization**: Implement caching and rate limiting to optimize costs and performance for department-scale usage

## User Stories

### Primary Users: Enterprise Security Teams & Compliance Officers

**US-1**: As a security officer, I want to see all AI requests and responses in real-time so that I can monitor for sensitive data exposure and policy violations.

**US-2**: As a compliance officer, I want to configure data classification rules (PII, financial data, proprietary information) so that the system automatically detects and blocks sensitive content.

**US-3**: As a security administrator, I want to create allow/block policies based on content types and user roles so that I can enforce organizational data governance policies.

**US-4**: As a compliance officer, I want comprehensive audit logs of all AI interactions so that I can generate compliance reports and investigate security incidents.

### Secondary Users: IT Administrators

**US-5**: As an IT administrator, I want to configure rate limiting and quotas for different users and departments so that I can control AI service costs and prevent abuse.

**US-6**: As an IT administrator, I want to monitor system performance and AI provider availability so that I can ensure reliable service for users.

**US-7**: As an IT administrator, I want to deploy the gateway in both cloud and on-premises environments so that I can meet different organizational infrastructure requirements.

**US-8**: As an IT administrator, I want a web dashboard to configure and monitor the gateway so that I can manage the system without requiring command-line access.
